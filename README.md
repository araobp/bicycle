# Bicycle

I develop in-bicycle network using the output from [sensor-network](https://github.com/araobp/sensor-network).

## Requirements

- Very low power consumption
- Cheap
- Show current speed, acceleration, temperature and humidity on a character LCD
- Save time-series data (speed, temperature, humidity, acceleration and location) onto EEPROM.
- Transfer the data to the cloud via WiFi, when I have just arrived at my home.

## Thing: my bicycle
